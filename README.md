This is a skin for the website Archiveofourown.org made by Electricalice.tumblr.com (electricalice on ao3 as well)

Feel free to use it as base for your own skins, but please credit me!
The code was adapted from The Blues skin by AO3, which in turn was adapted from 'colour flip combos' by lim @ ao3 and "Medium Blues" by Arduinna @ AO3

I do realize it's a very messy code and it might eb a nightmare to edit, I'm so sorry.
I also just checked compatibility on chrome and safari. Not sure about other browsers.


## To add a skin to your AO3 account 

* Make sure you're logged in your account on AO3
* go to *my dashboard* and then click on *Skins* (n the menu' on the right)
* click on the button *create new skin*
* Make sure Type is *Site Skin*
* Add a Title to your skin
* **Select and Copy ALL the code you'll find in the style-LIGHT.css file (or style-DARK.css if you want the darker version) you'll find in this repository**
* Paste the code *in the field 'CSS'*
* click **SUBMIT**
* scroll to the bottom on the page and click on "USE" 

### Now you have a new skin! It is now linked to your account, so every time you log into ao3 from whatever device you'll have it already set!



## How to remove the skin

* Make sure you're logged in your account on AO3
* go to 'my dashboard' and then click on 'Skins' (n the menu' on the right)
* click on 'revert to default skin'
